**Flashcards**

This project utilizes the powerful and versatile combination of Express.js and Node.js to create a simple yet effective flashcard system. With this application, users can create their own flashcards, view existing ones, and study them at their own pace. The application has been designed to be simple and easy to use, making it an ideal starting point for developers who want to build upon it and create a more advanced flashcard application tailored to their specific needs.
